Q1. The program will still give the right output so a programmer may not notice it. However, the memory that's being accessed may not be correct depending on which values are being inputted.
Q2. If the "a" is changed, it will make the temp pointer equal to a value instead of a memory address so it results in a program that will crash.


Side notes:
//temp is not being implemented properly
//canâ€™t use $t0
//v0
